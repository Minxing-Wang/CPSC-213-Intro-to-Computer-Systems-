#CPSC 213 

###Description

"The primary goal of 213 is to help you develop a model of computation that is rooted in what really happens when a program executes. 

In the first half of the course you will implement a simple instruction set in a hardware simulator and then examine how features of C are implemented in this instruction set. We will refer back to Java when considering memory management and polymorphism and to Dr Racket when considering functions as parameters. You will also develop an ability to read and understand small assembly-language programs. 

In the second half of the course, devices, asynchrony and thus asynchronous programming are introduced. Asynchrony is used to motivate threads and threads to motivate synchronization. You will see both how these abstractions are implemented and how they are used. You will see the connection between thread switch and procedure call. You will be introduced to the notion of atomicity and see why atomic memory-exchange operations are needed to implement synchronization. You will also examine the difference between busy and blocking waiting and solve a set of problems using monitors and condition variables and semaphores in C.
